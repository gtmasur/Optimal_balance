# Optimal balance for rotating shallow water flow
This repository includes the numerical implementation of optimal balance on 
the f-plane rotating shallow-water model. Optimal balance is a non-asymptotic 
diagnostic method to decompose balanced flow and unbalanced gravity-wave 
components. Thos method stands out with its easy implementation on an existing 
numerical code, and we, here, modified the open source code PyRsw written by 
Francis Poulin.
